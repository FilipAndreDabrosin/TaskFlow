    <p>
        TaskFlow was created as a school project, with the aim to learn how to use scripting languages. Troughout this project i learned a lot about Laravel, Blade, PHP, TailwindCSS and Javascript. I even learned about databases and MVC. Perhaps TaskFlow can be of use to you, if so then I believe that this project succeded more than I could have hoped for.
